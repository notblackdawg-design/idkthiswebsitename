            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Creating an account is optional. You may browse, post, and comment anonymously without an account. However, an account gives you additional features including a profile page, higher post rate limits, and the ability to manage your content across devices.
            </p>

              We reserve the right to suspend or permanently terminate any account at any time, for any reason, with or without notice. Reasons may include but are not limited to violations of these Terms, abusive behavior, or inactivity. We are not liable to you or any third party for any termination of your account.

            <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">4. Anonymous Posting</h2>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Users who do not have an account may post and comment anonymously. When an anonymous user first posts, a randomly generated Guest ID is created and stored in their browser's localStorage. This Guest ID is invisible to all users and is used only internally to allow deletion of that user's own content and to enforce rate limits. Clearing your browser data will permanently remove your Guest ID and your ability to delete your anonymous posts.
